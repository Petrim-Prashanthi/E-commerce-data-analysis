# 📊 E-Commerce Sales Analysis (EDA Project)

## Project Overview

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of an E-commerce sales dataset to uncover meaningful insights into **sales performance and monthly trends**.
Using **Python, Pandas, and Plotly**, the analysis highlights how sales evolve over time through clean data processing and interactive visualizations.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate **practical data analysis skills**, including data cleaning, aggregation, and storytelling through visual insights.

## Objectives

* Analyze overall sales performance of the E-commerce platform
* Identify and interpret **monthly sales trends**
* Perform data cleaning and aggregation using Pandas
* Build **interactive time-series visualizations** using Plotly
* Strengthen hands-on EDA and data visualization skills

---

## Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – Data manipulation & aggregation
* **Plotly** – Interactive data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## Analysis Performed

* Cleaned and preprocessed raw sales data
* Extracted **Order Month** from order dates
